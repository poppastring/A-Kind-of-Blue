## Inspiration

Named after Miles Davis's 1959 album "Kind of Blue," one of the most influential jazz albums of all time. Just as that album created a new modal approach to jazz improvisation, this theme pack aims to create a new approach to your coding environment - one that's both functional and inspiring.
